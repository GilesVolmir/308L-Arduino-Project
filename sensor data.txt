approximate average values of a 5mm photoresistor

in a flourescent lamp lit room at night: ~5Mohm to ~7Mohm (room light to passing shadow in front of it)



Voltage at input of light sensor (voltage divider with photoresistor and 6.4Mohm resistor, photoresistor to +5)

darkened room (overcast out windows): 75mV,  when holding hand ~1" above sensor: 50mV


same room with the flourescent lights on: 0.46V, 
	when holding hand ~1" above sensor: 0.15V 
	standing in front of set it casting my shadow: 0.29V
	casting shadow AND holding hand near: 0.05V
